- 👋 Hi, my name is Togochi, I'm 33 years old. I live in Siberia, the city of Krasnoyarsk.

- 👀 I am interested in developing games using the Unreal Engine, as well as using the SFML library written in C++.
- 🌱 I am currently learning to use exactly these tools. Before that, I spent six months learning the basics of programming in C++. Yes, this is my first language and programming experience.

- 💞️ I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate with other aspiring game developers who use Unreal Engine or mess with SFML code.
I am also glad to cooperate with 2-d and 3-d artists, game designers and anyone who is interested in creating interesting and orginal games in genres such as quests, party rpg, experimental and arthouse games. Yeah baby.
