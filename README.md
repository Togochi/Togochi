- 👋 Hi, my name is Togochi, I'm 33 years old. I live in Siberia, the city of Krasnoyarsk.

- 👀 I am interested in developing games using the С++, as well as using the UE5.
- 🌱 I am currently learning to use exactly these tools.

- 💞️ I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate with other aspiring game developers who use Unreal Engine or mess with SFML code.
